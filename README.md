# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

As a sports biomechanics student, I initially approached the AI course with curiosity and a touch of apprehension. The intersection of artificial intelligence and my field of study wasn't immediately apparent to me. However, as we delved into the fundamental concepts and basic algorithms of AI, I found myself increasingly captivated by the potential applications and the broader implications for sports science.
The course provided a comprehensive introduction to key AI concepts, such as machine learning, neural networks, and deep learning. I was particularly intrigued by how these could be applied to analyze athletic performance data. For instance, the potential to use machine learning algorithms to predict injury risks based on an athlete's biomechanical data is both exciting and promising for injury prevention strategies.
Learning about computer vision techniques opened my eyes to new possibilities in motion analysis. The ability of AI systems to track and analyze complex movements could revolutionize how we study and optimize athletic techniques. I can envision applications ranging from improving a swimmer's stroke efficiency to refining a golfer's swing mechanics.
The introduction to natural language processing (NLP) was unexpectedly relevant. While not directly related to biomechanics, I realized its potential in analyzing coach-athlete communications or processing large volumes of sports research papers to extract valuable insights.
One of the most valuable aspects of the course was learning about the ethical considerations surrounding AI. As we potentially integrate AI more deeply into sports science, understanding issues like data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the responsible use of predictive models becomes crucial.
The hands-on experience with basic AI algorithms was challenging but rewarding. Implementing simple neural networks and decision trees gave me a practical understanding of how these systems work. It also highlighted the importance of data quality and preprocessing in achieving meaningful results.
This course has not only expanded my technical knowledge but also broadened my perspective on the future of sports biomechanics. I now see AI as a powerful tool that, when used judiciously, can enhance our understanding of human movement and performance.
Moving forward, I'm eager to explore how I can incorporate AI techniques into my biomechanics research. The potential to combine traditional biomechanical analyses with machine learning models opens up exciting new avenues for investigation. Moreover, I believe that as sports scientists, we have a responsibility to guide the ethical and effective integration of AI into our field.
In conclusion, this AI course has been an eye-opening journey, equipping me with knowledge that I believe will be instrumental in shaping the future of sports biomechanics. It has inspired me to continue learning and to seek innovative ways to apply AI in enhancing athletic performance and injury prevention. 


## Background

My approach to tackling course assignments is all about leveraging AI and personal research to crack those tricky algorithms and coding problems. It's a game-changer for understanding complex stuff, fixing bugs in my code, and figuring out different ways to solve problems. Plus, it's super helpful when assignment instructions are about as clear as mud.
Let's be real - these issues pop up for pretty much every coding student out there. We've all been there, scratching our heads over a piece of code that just won't cooperate.
So, why am I so into this? Well, I'm all about working smarter, not harder. Mixing AI help with my own digging around is teaching me to think on my feet and solve problems like a pro. It's getting me ready for a future where teaming up with AI is just part of the job.
This stuff matters because it's shaking up how we learn, raising some interesting questions about AI in education, and prepping us for what's coming down the pike in tech. It puts us in control of our learning journey, which is pretty cool.
At the end of the day, I'm not just ticking boxes on assignments. I'm picking up real-world skills in using AI to solve problems. It's making me a more flexible coder, ready to roll with whatever the tech world throws my way. And that's what it's all about, right?



## How is it used?

How is it used?
This approach combines AI assistance with personal research to solve algorithmic and programming problems in coursework. Here's the process:

Encounter a challenging concept or coding problem in your assignment.
Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
Use AI tools (like ChatGPT) to explain complex concepts or suggest approaches.
Conduct personal research to verify and expand on the AI's suggestions.
Implement the solution, using AI for debugging if needed.
Reflect on the process and internalize the learning.

This solution is particularly useful in situations such as:

Late-night coding sessions when you're stuck on a problem
Approaching deadlines when you need to optimize your learning time
Encountering new programming concepts that aren't clearly explained in course materials

The primary users are computer science and programming students. Their needs include:

Clear explanations of complex concepts
Guidance on best coding practices
Help with debugging and error resolution
Exploration of alternative problem-solving approaches

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
unsorted_list = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_list = bubble_sort(unsorted_list)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_list)


## Data sources and AI methods
Data sources and AI methods
In this project, I utilize a combination of self-collected data and publicly available datasets. My primary sources include:

Course materials and assignments

These provide the core problems and concepts I'm working with.


Personal notes and code snippets

Collected during lectures and practice sessions.


Open-source programming datasets

GitHub Code Dataset
Python Programming Dataset on Kaggle


AI-assisted research using large language models

OpenAI's GPT models



The AI methods we employ include:
MethodApplicationNatural Language Processing (NLP)Understanding and generating human-readable explanationsCode GenerationAssisting with syntax and providing code examplesError DetectionIdentifying potential bugs in our codeInformation RetrievalFinding relevant documentation and resources
I use these AI methods to enhance our learning process, not to replace it. The AI serves as a tutor, providing explanations, suggestions, and feedback, which we then verify and expand upon through my own research and coding practice.
It's important to note that while we use AI for assistance, the final understanding and implementation come from our own efforts. This approach ensures that I'm actively learning and developing our problem-solving skills, rather than simply copying solutions.
By combining these data sources and AI methods, I create a rich, interactive learning environment that goes beyond traditional textbook-based education, preparing us for real-world programming challenges.

## Challenges

Limitations and Ethical Considerations
While our AI-assisted learning approach has been beneficial, it's important to acknowledge what our project does not solve and the limitations we've encountered:

Complex Assignment Completion:
Our method hasn't been able to tackle some of the more advanced, high-difficulty assignments. These often require a deeper understanding that can't be fully achieved through AI assistance alone.
Algorithm Comprehension:
Despite AI explanations, we still struggle to fully grasp certain algorithm formulas. This highlights a gap between theoretical understanding and practical application.
Overreliance on AI:
There's a risk of becoming too dependent on AI assistance, potentially hindering the development of independent problem-solving skills.
Superficial Understanding:
AI can provide quick answers, but it may not always foster the deep, intuitive understanding necessary for advanced programming concepts.

Ethical considerations include:

Academic Integrity:
Using AI assistance could be seen as a form of cheating if not disclosed or used appropriately within academic guidelines.
Skill Development:
Overuse of AI could potentially stunt the growth of crucial coding and problem-solving skills that come from struggling with difficult concepts.
Equity Issues:
Not all students may have equal access to AI tools, creating potential disparities in learning opportunities.
Privacy Concerns:
Sharing assignment details or personal code with AI systems raises questions about data privacy and intellectual property.
Misrepresentation of Abilities:
There's a risk of students appearing more skilled than they actually are, which could lead to issues in future academic or professional settings.

When deploying a solution like this, it's crucial to:

Set clear guidelines on appropriate use of AI in academic settings
Encourage a balance between AI assistance and independent learning
Develop methods to verify genuine understanding beyond AI-assisted solutions
Ensure equal access to AI tools for all students
Maintain transparency about the use of AI in completing assignments

By acknowledging these limitations and ethical considerations, we can work towards a more responsible and effective integration of AI in programming education.

## What next?

My AI-assisted learning project could evolve into a more comprehensive study tool. I envision developing a mobile app that uses AI to help with a variety of STEM subjects, not just programming. This app could scan homework problems, offer step-by-step solutions, and create personalized study plans based on my progress. To make this happen, I'd need to improve my skills in app development, UI/UX design, and machine learning. I'd also benefit from mentorship by experienced developers and maybe some guidance on educational technology regulations. The goal is to create a tool that adapts to my learning style, making it easier to tackle complex concepts and assignments. While it's ambitious, this growth could significantly enhance my learning experience and potentially help other students too.
